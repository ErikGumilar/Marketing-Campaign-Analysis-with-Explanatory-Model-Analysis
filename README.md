Have you ever gotten a shopping promo with a big discount that coincided on a certain day? Let's say that every Friday the "BaBa" shopping app gives a 50% discount for 1 month. But when you check the next month the discount doesn't exist.

Have you ever thought about what happened so that the online shopping application "BaBa" did not provide discounts again for this month? Or is your hypothesis only limited to, "maybe the company is losing money"?

This hypothesis is not entirely true. The online shopping application "BaBa" may have reviewed the campaign they did a month ago and received information that the discount shopping campaign was not able to attract as many customers as previously predicted.
